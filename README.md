# NBA-Data-Analysis
This repository is an example of some work i've done with web scrapping and cleaning of data.

In the jupyter notebook below, I scrapped data from an NBA stats website. I then took this data and cleaned
the data up and created a table to veiw the information and stats for each player. 
I then made the data easily downloadable CSV file.

With this project i learned a lot about using BeautifulSoup 4, which is a library within Python, 
It has also taught me a lot about using Juypter Notebooks, and different ways to vizualize simple data.
